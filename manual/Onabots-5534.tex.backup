\newpage\section*{RoboRIO}

Some information about the RoboRIO.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/ni_roborio}

Include information about the various ports, their naming.

INPUT Power for RoboRIO. Do not use screws facing top, these hold the black plastic to the RoboRIO. Screws to tighten wires are found on the left side of the black plastic.

Another picture showing the labelled parts of the roborio would be good.

%%
\newpage\section*{Motor Controllers}

\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{images/spark}

Different types of motor controllers. List the different kinds as well as advantages and disadvantages of each. Include links to AndyMark with prices and descriptions.

A motor controller can control more than one motor but need a PWM split cable.

Talk about PWM, as Pulse Width Modulated. Varies the amount of time that a voltage is applied to the motor.

Range of motor controller values: \num{-1} to \num{1} with \num{0} indicating no motion.

Actually good to set motor speed from an encoder instead of motor power. Speed changes with friction, internal resistance, and battery voltage.

Wiring requirements, what size gauge is needed?

Braking vs Coast mode

\section*{Calculaion}

\marginpar{This is a margin x x x x x x x paragraph. It contains a smaller font and is obviously found in the margin of the page on which it is placed.}

The course grade is the average of each quarter grade from a combination of project maintenance; education and outreach; and exam grades.
%
Each quarter grade is the ratio of points earned to points possible.
%
Grades restart at the beginning of each quarter.
%
The semester grade is reduced by \SI{0.5}{\percent} for every absence and tardy.  In addition, negative behavior can result in a similar reduction and possibly reassignment to another project.
%
The approximate weight of each category is shown below.

	\vspace*{5mm}
	\begin{center}
	{%
		\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.35}
		\noindent
		\begin{tabular}{ l c l S }
		Category						&	Weight	&	Frequency	&	{Points\textsuperscript{1}}	\\
		\midrule
		Project Maintenance		&	\SI{40}{\percent} &	Weekly		&	\num{5.0}	\\
		Education and Outreach	&	\SI{40}{\percent}	&	Biweekly 	&	\num{5.0}	\\
		Midterm and Final Exam	&	\SI{20}{\percent}	&	Quarterly	&	\num{2.5}	\\
		\end{tabular}
	}
	\end{center}
	\vspace*{5mm}
	
	\noindent
	This shows the number of points for each day of class.
	%
	Combined, the exams are worth twenty percent of the semester grade.
	%
	
	
	
	\vspace*{5mm}

\noindent


\section*{Rubric}

Most grades are determined holistically.
%
Points are assigned from the points possible and the letter (quality grade) using the scale shown.

	\begin{center}
	{%
	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
	\begin{tabular}{ l l c }
		Letter & Description	&	Percent	\\
		\midrule
		A & Excellent		&	100	\\
		B & Good				&   85	\\
		C & Average			&   75	\\
		D & Minimal			&   65	\\
		F & Unacceptable	&    0	\\
	\end{tabular}
	}%
	\end{center}


\section*{Review}
Students may request a review of their grade by submitting supporting evidence no more than one week after the due date. Evidence must usually be submitted in writing. This allows consideration of extenuating circumsances. Project maintenance grades will be entered the following Wednesday.

\section*{Failing}
Students whose semester grade is D or F are given an explicit opportunity to raise their grade through suggestions and opportunities. These students will be subject to a weekly or biweekly review and have parent communication by mail, e-mail, or phone.

Students will not fail the class due to attendance. In other words, attendance and behavior will not reduce a passing grade below 60\%.






\newpage
\section*{Course Description}


\textit{The Service Learning course at Onaway High School 
 provides meaningful experiences
 that reinforce learning
 by connecting students with their local community.}

\vspace*{3mm}
 
Include some good pictures of students from the different project areas. Include a goal from each area as well as the general tasks and projects.

\vspace*{2cm}

\noindent
What this means and how the class works. What do the students do and what are their roles.

The way this works:

	student selects an existing project to maintain and develop requiring about 
  \SIrange{20}{30}{\minute} per day, 

  student uses remaining time for education and outreach (see explanation).

%% HISTORY
%%
\newpage
\section*{History}


%% This is almost a side-note that can be used to emphasize the nature of the 
%% course.
Course originated in \textbf{YEAR} when the guidance counselor approached me about
providing an additional science class for the following year. At the time I was
looking into Advanced Placement courses and came across an A.P. Environmental
Studies class. I also spoke with the new elementary principal who was part of the GLSI Network when she was a teacher. Through GLSI she had received a \$5,000 grant. Combined with a Learn and Serve grant for \$6,000 she had intended to build a school greenhouse. Previous teachers had tried to start school recycling programs at various times but limited class time made this difficult to sustain.

The result of these conversations was a class called Service Learning that was project driven in four areas: Animals and Habitat, Fisheries and Water, Plants and Forestry, and Recycling and Energy.


%% This is also something of a side note that describes what I have learned
%% while teaching the course.
\section*{Realizations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Everything takes longer than expected.
\item Many community partners exists in our community,
\item Projects rarely turn out as expected,
\item Be adaptable and ready for change,
\item Students become possesive of their projects
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sample Projects -- Successful}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fossil park (USFW)
\item Hydroponic Lettuce (B. Moore)
\item Lake Trout (USFW, Trout Unlimited)
\item Salmon in the Classroom (HBAAA, DNR)
\item School Forest Management Plan (Martell, DNR)
\item School Greenhouse (GLSI, Garden Club)
\item School-wide recycling program (Emmet County Transfer Station)
\item Solar panels and wind turbine (GLEE Program)
\item Sturgeon on Loan (DNR, SFT)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Assessment and Evaluation}


	\subsection*{Service Projects \hfill 40\%}

	Graded weekly.	Five points per day of class, whether it is a half-day or a full-day of class.

	Students may work in teams (of up to two beginning Winter 2018). Groups of three were permissible earlier.

	Some outreach related to a project is required and may impact Service grade if not completed.

	See Service Project Areas for ongoing and transient projects.

	Consider rotating manager responsibilities (track assignments in group in case of absences)
	
	Should include tracking of data.

	Project maintenance grading is based upon the Area. For example, all students in the Animals and Habitat group receive the same project grade.


	\subsection*{Education and Outreach \hfill 40\%}

	Student selected activites.

	Graded bi-weekly. Five points for full day of class, nothing for a half-day of class.

	Graded based upon submitted student form of what they did: electronic or paper
	
	See Education and Outreach categories for guidelines.


	\subsection*{Presentations \hfill 20\%}

	Consists of a midterm and a final.
	
	Weight is 2.5 points per full day of class. Half days do not contribute.

	Midterm is a research project related to the class. Grade is based upon presentation format: Video (A or B); Powerpoint or Prezi (B or C); Written paper or display (C or D).



	\begin{itemize}
	\item Rubrics used for each item (see next page)
	\item Students work in teams of their choice of up to 2. Additional students reduce amount for all or part of a pair
	\item Students submit their own outreach points on a form, due on following Monday up to Wednesday
	\item Outreach points are assigned based upon evidence, importance of activity.
	\item Q1 exam is research, Q2 exam is reflection
	\item Two kinds of required outreach: project and general.
	\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Project Maintenance}

Project Maintenance
- students may work alone or with one partner on a project
- graded weekly and holistically on a A--F scale, overall progress on day
- anticipate about 25--30 minutes of work each days
- involves
	-	data collection and reporting
	-	inspections about twice a week or more
	-	fixing issues indicated previously
	-	each area should have a project manager
			manager signs off on tasks confirming they were done correctly and fully
	-	general maintenance and recording of data, reporting of data timely manner
	-	required outreach is part of each group
	-	daily schedule of student accomplishments
	-	students may appeal grade with justification (in writing)
	-	data turned in weekly, grades may be updated through following Wednesday (or so)
	-	how is data submitted
	-	students may resubmit project once a week


\newpage
Outreach points are updated every two weeks

\subsubsection*{Levels}
There are five levels or Education and Outreach with varying amounts of points. The maximum number
of points may be increased by 20\% for events that happen outside of the school day.

\subsubsection*{5 -- Major \hfill 2 weeks}
These activities are very important for the class. 



\subsubsection*{Required}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Optional}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item Informational signs
\end{itemize}




Areas (24 students)
- Animals and Habitat	(4)
- Fisheries and Water	(8)
- Plants and Forestry	(8)
- Recycling and Energy	(6)
- Technology and Data	(-)

Students receive an overall grade each week on their area from:
- Inspection	0--4		A--F
- Data			0--4		A--F

Absences and tardies reduce the overall grade: 0.5\% per absence and 0.25\% per tardy. This amounts to about 5.66 points for any absence. During an absence of a team, another group will be required to step
up and complete required tasks. This earns additional points for those involved. There is a list of
substitutes. First choice given to those with the fewest points.

Options
- Advistory meeting input
	provides useful input (A--F), 5 points






\subsection*{Service Projects}

\marginnote{\noindent\qrcode[height=0.8in]{http://207.74.77.189/servicepics/}}

% \noindent Student-selected groups perform routine maintenance, collect and analyze data, present information, and communicate with others. Grades are assigned once a week based on project inspections, paperwork submission, and required education and outreach. Students not involved in a project may earn points through additional education and outreach. Service projects are expected to take 20--30 minutes each day.

\begin{itemize}[label=$-$,nosep]
\item New or existing projects, may be in different areas
\item Students select teams and projects
\item Teams earn points divided equally among members

\item Weekly group grade based upon project
\item Some tasks rotate among groups (recycling? cardboard? cleaning room, counters?)
\item Expect 20--30 minutes per day
\item Collect and analyze data, present information, communicate with others
\item Option for no project -- new project or strictly outreach
\item One or more inspections per week
\item Some projects have required outreach
\item 40\% of final grade
\item project set-up and break down at beginning and end
\end{itemize}

\section*{Tuesday, September 5, 2017 \hfill Day 1}

	Began class by surveying student interest and background related to computers. Only one student had experience with replacing hardware although several were able to replace mice and keyboards. A majority of students would like to learn some sort of programming. There were some students who took the class for something different.

	We looked at the outside of the case and noticed the number of USB ports for mice and keyboards.  Next involved students removing, observing, and replacing hardware. Students took a harddrive, placed it in a tray, and inserted it into the tower. Students then connected power and data cables. Students also removed memory chips and replaced.

	After hardware we moved on to booting up a vanilla Debian Stretch system. This system has no graphical interface and very little in the way of system software. Students logged in as root, created a new user using adduser, and then logged in as that user. At this point, we were past 9:15am  and several in the class went for grab-and-go breakfast.

	NB: Ashlee Crusoe is on vacation from September 6 for about a week.

	\paragraph*{Goals.}Goals for the second day of class include becoming familar with the command shell. Students should be able to use the following commands: echo, adduser, passwd, cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, man, passwd, logout, and nano. We will use a simple editor (nano) to create a file, change the executable bit, and execute the script. Demonstrated use of the commands until 8:45. Students implemented commands until 9:15 and then were released for breakfast.

	NB: Madison Brilley and Maggie Jones dropped. Chelsea Brewbaker and Garret Roat added.

Also give students the option of gnome, firefox, etc. Teach them how to launch programs from the command line and also the start menu.





	After this we will look at installing software. Note that only root can install software since anything that is installed might pose a threat. Root must know what they are doing.

	Give students advice on selecting good passwords. Passwords should not contain any word found in a directory or a common permutation. Passwords should be at least 8 characters and should include punctuation, numbers, and a combination of upper and lower case letters.

	The two commands are apt-cache and apt-get. I will have students install some simply software and

	The first day of class we went through the grading of the class and what students must do to earn their points. The first week of class will be mostly organizational stuff -- setting up the projects. Students divided into their teams. There are few students in the Plants and Forestry group so each group will send students on a rotation to help.


\section*{Wednesday, September 6, 2017 \hfill Day 2}

	NB: Holly Hoeft dropped.

	Decided to keep grades in a YAML or Perl file for each week. This will allow easy processing and placement on the class web site.
	
	All students were provided with a full set of outreach points for the week (see presentation): returning the syllabus signature page (5), providing a summary of the week (5, 10 if including a picture), and providing a description of intended outreach for next week (5).

	\paragraph*{Animals and Habitat.}
	Students have prepared the back counter for animals and have completed an inventory. The inventory has yet to be placed online.
	
	\paragraph*{Fisheries and Water.}
	Rebecca and Cheyenne have expressed an interest in presenting at the GLSI Regional meeting in Gaylord. Check with Olivia is this would be appropriate. Austin, Lauren, and Robert have settled on Bass in the commons area. Maddie will contact Tim about trout and shocking this fall. Becca will get sturgeon water on her own. We will not have a separate degassing tank for the sturgeon since very few water changes were done. Cooper will handle trout and goldfish. Cheyenne has adopted salmon.
	
	We need buckets with lids for water.
	
	\paragraph*{Plants and Forestry.}
	Nana is breaking down the hydroponics system in Mr. Pyles room. We need to have a system running by the end of the week and seeds planted in the classroom for germination. Rockwool was not found.

	\paragraph*{Recycling and Energy.}
	Recyclers include Zebany, Sheri, BreAnna, and Randi; Holly has dropped. All have been trained to read the meters (greenhouse and solar/wind) and will do so once a week. Zebany will get information about NEMCOG grants by the end of the week.

\newpage\section*{Soft Skills}

	Due to it's nature as an applied courses, students will be evaluated on their knowledge and use of soft skills in the context of their projects. These skills will help determine project assignments. Provide examples illustrating that students can demonstrate each skill.

	\subsection*{1. Teamwork and Collaboration}
	Employers want employees who play well with others -- who can effectively work as part of a team. ``That means sometimes being a leader, sometimes being a good follower, monitoring the progress, meeting deadlines and working with others across the organization to achieve a common goal,'' says Lynne Sarikas, the MBA Career Center Director at Northeastern University.

	The ability to work in teams, relate to people and manage conflict is a valuable asset in the workplace. This skill is important to get ahead -- and as you advance in your career, the aptitude to work with others becomes even more crucial. Personal accomplishments are important on your resume, but showing that you can work well with others is important too.

	It is imperative for college-bound students to function efficiently and appropriately in groups, collaborate on projects and accept constructive criticism when working with others. People who succeed only when working alone will struggle in college and beyond, as the majority of careers require collaboration.


	\subsection*{2. Enthusiasm and Attitude}
	Give examples of how you improved employee morale in a past position, or how your positive attitude helped motivate your colleagues or those you managed. Earnest suggests: ``Some people are naturally bubbly and always upbeat. Others have a more tame and low-energy demeanor. Especially if you tend to be more low-key, smile when you shake the interviewer's hand and make an extra effort to add some intonation and expression to your responses.''

	Enthusiasm, Positive attitude, Accepting responsibility, Eagerness to learn new things, Open to new ideas

	
	\subsection*{3. Verbal and Non-verbal Communication}
	Communication skills involve active listening, presentation as well as excellent writing capabilities. One highly sought-after communication skill is the ability to explain technical concepts to partners, customers and coworkers that aren't tech savvy.

	Students can demonstrate these skills through interaction with peers, communication with staff, participating in meetings, constructing e-mails, creating displays, writing letters, giving presentations, using appropriate body language, maintaining eye contact, actively listening, asking good questions, and speaking on the telephone.


	\subsection*{4. Problem Solving and Critical Thinking}
	The ability to use creativity, reasoning, past experience, information, and available resources to assess issues and resolve issues is attractive because it saves everyone at the organization valuable time. Highlight this skill by listing an example of when your organization had a sticky situation and you effectively addressed it.

	Project management skills: Organization, planning and effectively implementing projects and tasks for yourself and others is a highly effective skill to have. In the past, this was a job in itself. Nowadays, many companies aren't hiring project managers because they expect all of their employees to possess certain characteristics of this skill.


	\subsection*{5. Professionalism and Work Ethic}
	Employers are looking for employees that take initiative, are reliable and can do the job right the first time. Managers don't have the time or resources to babysit, so this is a skill that is expected from all employees. Don't make the hiring manager second-guess by sending a resume with typos, errors and over-exaggerated work experience.

	Employers are on the lookout for people who take pride in their work, and are confident enough to put their name to it. They also respect people who can hold their hands up when things go wrong, and don't pass the buck. Everyone makes mistakes -- it's how you react and learn from them that counts.

% 	
% 
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 	
% 		\item Acting as a team player -- this means not only being cooperative, but also displaying strong leadership skills when necessary.
% 
% 		\item 5. Leadership: While it is important to be able to function in a group, it is also important to demonstrate leadership skills when necessary. Both in college and within the workforce, the ability to assume the lead when the situation calls for it is a necessity for anyone who hopes to draw upon their knowledge and ``hard'' skills in a position of influence.
% 
% 		Companies wish to hire leaders, not followers. The best way for students to develop this skill as they prepare for college is to search for leadership opportunities in high school. This could mean, among other things, acting as captain of​ an athletic team, becoming involved in student government or leading an extracurricular group. 
% 		
% 		\item Employers want employees who play well with others -- who can effectively work as part of a team. ``That means sometimes being a leader, sometimes being a good follower, monitoring the progress, meeting deadlines and working with others across the organization to achieve a common goal,'' says Lynne Sarikas, the MBA Career Center Director at Northeastern University.
% 
% 		\item A good team player has the team goals clear in their mind and works with others to achieve them. They are open and honest, and offer constructive suggestions and listen to others.
% 
% 		\item A report from The Economist Intelligence Unit found that 63 percent of executives believe today's workforce lacks collaboration and teamwork skills. How do you know if you personally lack such skills? Try asking yourself the following questions:
% 
% 		- Do you think your approach to things is always the best?
% 
% 		- Do you hate it when other people question your approach to things?
% 
% 		- Do you hate working on assignments that require you to rely on others in order to get work done?
% 
% 		\item No person is an island. You need to be comfortable working, collaborating and interacting with others. So pitch in when needed, respect others opinions, sit in on group meetings and provide solutions. 
% 
% 		\item Teamwork -- cooperative, gets along with others, agreeable, supportive, helpful, collaborative

% 
% 	It's more than just speaking the language. Communication skills involve active listening, presentation as well as excellent writing capabilities. One highly sought-after communication skill is the ability to explain technical concepts to partners, customers and coworkers that aren't tech savvy.
%

% 		\item It's more than just speaking the language. Communication skills involve active listening, presentation as well as excellent writing capabilities. One highly sought-after communication skill is the ability to explain technical concepts to partners, customers and coworkers that aren't tech savvy.
% 
% 		\item this is paramount to almost any job. Communication involves articulating oneself well, being a good listener and using appropriate body language.
% 		
% 		\item A common complaint among employers is that young people do not know how to effectively carry on a conversation and are unable to do things like ask questions, listen actively and maintain eye contact.
% 
% 		The current prevalence of electronic devices has connected young individuals to one another, but many argue it has also lessened their ability to communicate face-to-face or via telephone. These skills will again be important not only in college, where students must engage with professors to gain references and recommendations for future endeavors, but beyond as well.
% 
% 		An inability to employ these skills effectively translates poorly in college and job interviews, for instance. High school students can improve these traits by conversing with their teachers in one-to-one settings. This is also excellent training for speaking with college professors. Obtaining an internship in a professional setting is also a wonderful method to enhance communication and interpersonal skills.
% 
% 		\item This doesn't mean you have to be a brilliant orator or writer. It does mean you have to express yourself well, whether it's writing a coherent memo, persuading others with a presentation or just being able to calmly explain to a team member what you need.
% 
% 		\item This is perhaps the most common entry on person specifications for job vacancies, and for good reason. Skilled communicators get along well with colleagues, listen and understand instructions, and put their point across without being aggressive. They can change their style of communication to suit the task in hand -- this can be invaluable in many different situations, from handling conflict to trying to persuade a customer of the benefits of buying your product. If you've got good communication skills you should be able develop constructive working relationships with colleagues and be able to learn from constructive criticism.
% 
% 		\item Communication skills are one of the most important soft skills managers need to be effective. Managers must possess the ability to get their point across to employees, co-workers and customers. Effective communications ensures that everyone is on the same page and know what is expected of them.
% 
% 		\item The activities in this section will not only help participants practice and recognize how they provide information to others, but also help them consider how others may prefer to receive information. It is important to reinforce with participants that communication skills involve give and take -- and they can, indeed, be learned and strengthened over time.
% 		
% 		\item By ``communication,'' I mean more than just being able to exchange information with colleagues face-to-face, on the phone, and via emails and reports. Everyone can pretty much do that.
% 
% 		Rather, employers are looking for more advanced communication skills, particularly in the STEM fields. Businesses want employees who can communicate complex ideas clearly to the layman and the expert alike and through multiple mediums. Persuasion and negotiation skills are crucial in this respect. If you want to be a highly employable and progressive professional, you'll really need to master these advanced communication skills.
% 		
% 		\item Your interview is a great opportunity to demonstrate how well you communicate, so be sure you prepare and practice responses to showcase your best skills. Earnest says, ``Be concrete with these examples, and bring proof to the interview. Provide examples of materials you created or written campaigns you developed in past positions.''
% 		
% 		\item Articulate and skilled communicators are able to clearly express thoughts and ideas and understand the tasks at hand. Also, they get along with colleagues because they tend to be better listeners.
% 		
% 		\item Communication -- oral, speaking capability, written, presenting, listening.

- video

Monitoring (collection and recording of data)
- temperature (daily)
- water quality monitoring
- growth rate
- inventory

Maintenance (daily and weekly tasks)
- food, nutrients

Paperwork (applications, permits, internal reports)
paperwork is something that is completed in many forms. These include permits, applications, permission slips, area applications, etc.

- field trip requests
- transportation 
- sturgeon
- salmon
- sea lamprey

Research
- research is performed primarily when students have questions to answer, are developing a new project, or just learning about their subject.
- varies based upon the time of year. For example, students in the fisheries group will perform research prior to receiving the fish. They will have more stuff to do in the beginning as there is limited maintenance to perform.



\newpage
\section*{\it Fisheries and Water}

The \textit{Fisheries and Water (FW)} team is responsible for managing aquaria in school (room 302, other classrooms, and offices).

On a daily basis, students feed fish, check mechanical equipment, perform water changes, check temperature.

On a biweekly basis, students monitor water quality (temperature, pH, total ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate), rinse filters, provide updates at a team meeting.

On a month basis, students check chiller flow, update community partners, 







\newpage
\section*{\it Assessment and Evaluation}


\subsection*{\it Project Maintenance \hfill 40\%}\,

Each (month? week? every other week?) students apply to work on a project with no more than one other student. If multiple students sign up for a project, the project is divided by the instructor or by the students. Each week, students complete maintenance and verify that tasks are completed by signing off. Each student is expected to sign their own initials. These forms are to be completed daily and placed in the project binder (need 1 inch binders per project). These binders are for long-term maintenance records. It should include graphs, charts, contact information. There is also an area binder and a class binder that contains more information.

Students are graded based upon the completion of the project. Students who are absent have their grade reduced by 0.5\% per absence or tardy. Excessive tardiness results in additional penalties of some sort. Groups who fill in earn volunteer points.

Project Maintenance is graded holistically with a letter-grade and based upon a rubric. Groups may be assigned a project for maintenance if there are many students in the group or few people in the class. Inspections happen at least twice a week with one occuring on Friday. Feedback is provided to groups as needed.

Some outreach is required of the entire group. Students may forego team outreach. Students receive points for attending team meetings. During a team meeting, students share their accomplishments and provide suggestions to other groups. 


\begin{itemize}[label=$-$]
	\item When can students change groups?

\vspace*{4mm}

\subsection*{\it Education and Outreach \hfill 40\%}

Education and Outreach consists of additional tasks that students accomplish that are not based upon daily maintenance. Ideally these are activities that deal with students actively interacting with the community or partners.

There is a form that students complete on a bi-weekly basis where they submit their outreach points. Some project maintenance selections have required outreach points otherwise students are removed from the group.

\vspace{4mm}

\subsection*{\it Exam Presentations \hfill 20\%}

The midterm and final exams consists of presentations. The midterm presentation occurs around halfway through the semester and consists of knowledge presented by the student about a research topic of their choice. Ideally this consists os a video presentation of around 3 minutes. Students may choose an alternate form for reduced points and make up the difference through additional outreach. Students may also present to a community partner in lieu of this knowledge presentation. The midterm presentation is worth 10\% of the final grade and occurs during the first half of the class.

The final exam is also a presentation about a reflection throughout the course. Students are expected to compile pictures, videos, etc. It is expected that students will address their teamwork skills, experiences, impact upon the community, etc. Students may complete a written paper instead for reduced points and make up the difference through outreach. Students may put points into any category they wish.

\section*{\it Service Projects}

Service projects challenge students to apply critical thinking and problem solving skills in context. Students solve practical problems using teamwork, collected data, and research. Results are communicated within the school and to community partners.

\subsection*{\it Project Areas}

Each student applies to one of five project areas. After approval, the student joins a team to complete maintenance using protocols, and collect and diseminate information to the public. Each students chooses to be graded individually or as part of a group.

\subsection*{\it Assessment}

Forty percent of the semester grade is determined by the quality of task completion in four categories. Once a week, a grade is assigned to each category and averaged to determine a group grade. Students may accept the group grade or request an individual grade based upon their own accomplishments.

% 	\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}[label=$-$]

	Follow protocols, complete tasks, Label materials, put away items, empty trash, clean up counters, sweep floor, tighten handles, put away equipment, push in chairs.
	
	\item \textit{Information and Communication.} These are the communication of information as a group. This portion is not about who does the work but if the work gets done. Think of this as required outreach. The person who performs the outreach earns additional points.

	Submit reports, take inventory, collect data, finish assignments, answer questions, calendar, budget, create displays and posters, update partners, participate in meetings, publish articles, update NEMI GLSI, update class, take quiz, attend lesson

2. Research
3. Displays
4. Training
5. Lessons
6. Setting up
7. Creating video

Students complete maintenance in groups of their choice and may change prior to any week with prior instructor approval. Students work as part of a department team on all tasks. On applications, students select the projects they are willing to maintain. Unclaimed projects are assigned to a group that has excess students to maintain. Up to two students may work on a project without incurring additional work. If fewer students work in an area, they will either receive additional credit or have reduced tasks.

As an example, suppose there are four students who choose the sturgeon and no students who select the goldfish. The goldfish tank is then assigned to the students working on the sturgeon. Students are to develop a plan to rotate responsibilities or use one supplied by the instructor.

Posted on each tank is the protocol and set of instructions. Water changes are listed 

Each tank has posted a set of instructions for daily maintenance. As a substitute, a student is responsible for taking care of these tasks. This paper is also posted on the wall, and filed in the folder, and posted on the web site.

There are also a set of tasks that occur less frequently. These are tasks for those who are in the area. Students assigned to an area who do not complete the tasks regularly, anything less than a `C' may be reassigned to another area.

Roughly half of class time spent on these areas. Team interview and tasks. Additional outreach points for education such as watching video.

Grades are determined by the quality of completed tasks in each of four areas.

- assigned individually, group, or by team
- determined by weekly inspection
- overall number of signatures
- completion of tasks

Volunteer us worth 4 or 5 points since it is only maintenance.

Teams are collectively responsible for area. If something is no done, it falls to the team. Area assignments determined at beginning of week or by signature daily paperwork. Something like daily log with more detail. Separated by area.

Maximum of 5 pts per day. 2.5 pts on a half-day. Letter grades of A--F assigned on 4 pt scale. May use half-grades or $+$/$-$ grading. Average of 4 areas at 0.25 pt resolution.

Group gets overall grade. There is a group grade determined from the four areas that is assigned to everyone. There are also individual grades assigned based upon individual contributions.

If a student elects an individual grade, they are assessed on the work they did in each of the four areas and their contributions to a working team. Note that volunteer work is individual.

Default: students receive individual grades in an area.

Maintenance		G

Organization	G	this could be a rotated task

Information		I

Communication	I

Students who are reassigned earn volunteer points. Individual grades can be combined with group grades.

Another method is to divide an area into tasks that must be completed each day and then assign individual students to the rotating tasks for, say, 3 days at a time.. Then, each student is rated individually. Attendance should remain a factor in grading but reduced. If a student is not present, their grade is reduced by 0.5\% since there was no contribution. Strictly speaking, this should be closer to 0.47\%. Justification: we have 10 half-days, and about 3--4 snow days results in about 0.4878\%.

If groups vote, they may also choose to divide into subteams: Lake Sturgeon, etc. Note that there may not be enough work for some groups at times.

Take the choice away?

\subsection*{\it Application Process}
Applications for project area (see appendix on forms). Applications based upon numbers of students. Students may be reassigned to an area on a rotating basis to cover all major projects. Students will also need to sign up as a substitute for at least one area.


\subsection*{\it Grades}
\marginnote{Each of the four areas are weighed equally when calculating the service project grade.}
%
\noindent Students receive a group grade based upon completion and quality of daily and weekly tasks. Students may opt to have their grade calculated individually (see requirements elsewhere). Letter grades are assigned to each category and then averaged. Points are scaled based upon the number of school days in the week.
%
Distribution of points (maintenance, display, data, organization). Include a chart in the margin.



\paragraph{\it Individual Grade Option.}
Instead of a group grade, a student may elect each week to have their grade calculated individually. See here for additional details and requirements.

\end{document}




\newpage\section*{Assessment and Evaluation}
\marginnote{Discuss the areas and reasonsing for grading.}
Students earn their points through a combination of (a) project maintenance or development, (b) education and outreach, and (c) final and midterm presentations. In each area, students select how they will earn their points and will be graded based upon a common rubric. Students may earn additional points by adopting a minor project or performing additional education and outreach.

\subsection*{Project Maintenance \hfill 40\%}
\marginnote{Discuss the frequency of grades and refer to the rubric. Include option for individual grade.}
Each student applies a project area to perform maintenance and upkeep. By default, each member of the team receives the same grade unless a student chooses to have their grade calculated individually. Each project has a set of daily and weekly tasks that are to be completed. Grades are assigned weekly. Students who are absent or late have their grade reduced by 0.5\% per instance. Inappropriate behavior may result in a student removed from a group or confined to the classroom.

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Group Grade \ldots Each student receives the same group grade based upon following protocols, performing maintenance and upkeep, and completing additional tasks assigned to the group.
	
	\item Individual Grade \ldots The student receives an invididual grade based upon the completion of a journal and keeping track of their own accomplishments. The tasks remain the same. Items that directly relate to the student.
	\end{enumerate}

	{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.35}
	\begin{tabular}{ l l p{4in} }
	Maintenance  & 40 & Protocols, inspection \\
	Information  & 40 & Data collection, reports, forms \\
	Organization & 20 & Materials in order, location \\
	\end{tabular}
	}

	\vspace*{3mm}
	
	\par Is there a manager who signs off or a student who inspects? This could be optional for outreach points. Or this could be something rotated through the group.

	\par Journal \ldots students can keep a journal or daily log of activities to increase their project points. This journal will result in an increase of 10\% on their project grade and be extremely useful when performing their midterm and final exam. Criteria for each is distributed early in the class. I can also increase points at the end of the course based upon teacher observation of soft skills.

	
\noindent
\paragraph{Rubric.}%
Students are graded on the following categories at least twice a week.


Area is Clean and Organized - 25\%, Inventory bi-weekly. This includes the cabinets. Cabinet should be organized, labelled, etc. Should include a check-list of items that need to be accounted for.
A - Exceptional. All items are put away, trash in bin, no materials left out
B - Some improvement
C - Maintained only
D - Left worse
F - Unacceptable

Tasks Completed - 25\%. Varies depending upon the number and importance of the tasks, number of students present, and size of the group. Tasks are identify by student
A - All daily and weekly tasks completed
B - All daily
C - Most major, half minor
D - 
F - 

Data Collection \ldots  - 25\%
A - Data collected, Accurate, and Organized
B - 
C - 
D - 
F - 

Displays - 25\% \ldots Information compiled are presented publicly on bulletin boards, display, etc. this include a calendar of events associated with the group. If no data applies, then this area is not included in the average. This should be an easy one as very little data needs to be collected. This can include updating a graph or chart on a bi-weekly basis, printing, and placing in the folder or updating an online spreadsheet (i like the last)
A - Data collected, accurate, Timely, Reportning on the data
B - 
C - 
D - 
F - 


Students who fail to perform required tasks in a personal project receive fewer points or may have their certification revoked. What if someone does not contact their community partner?

	
\noindent
\paragraph*{Minor Project.}%
Students may also elect to manage a minor project with up to one additional student. This may replace a major project in which case the student will perform maintenance and research related to their project but will not be directly associated with an area. Students may earn outreach points for working on a minor project in addition to a major project.

	\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Aquapoincs \ldots research, set-up, manage, and report on a small hydroponic system.
	
	\item Biofilter \ldots research, construct, manage, and report on a student-created aquarium biofilter.
	
	\item Hydroponics \ldots research, construct, manage, and report  on a student-created hydroponic system.
	
	
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{multicols}






Responsible for maintenance. Absences and tardies affect grade. Points made up through outreach. Volunteers may perform basic maintenance at 5 points. See examples in appendix. Established projects that have a definite agenda are major projects. Minor projects are transient and only exist for a limited amount of time.

Consider how students may choose their projects. Students choose a major and one or more minors. The major is the primary project maintenance that is performed by the student.

Students may choose how they are graded. This can either be individually or with their group. By default, students receive the group grade. However, during any week, students can choose to use their individual journal grade that lists their accomplishments. However, certain parts are still attributed to the individual grade.

Can students choose more than one project? Yes, but how? Students may not adopt more than one project unless they choose an individual grading method, a personal project, or something else to make certain they are completing their work.

Develop a list of minor projects that students can work on. Students could also

\newpage\section*{\it Soft Skills}

	Due to it's nature as an applied courses, students will be evaluated on their knowledge and use of soft skills in the context of their projects. These skills will help determine project assignments. Provide examples illustrating that students can demonstrate each skill.

	\subsection*{\it 1. Teamwork and Collaboration}
	Employers want employees who play well with others -- who can effectively work as part of a team. ``That means sometimes being a leader, sometimes being a good follower, monitoring the progress, meeting deadlines and working with others across the organization to achieve a common goal,'' says Lynne Sarikas, the MBA Career Center Director at Northeastern University.

	The ability to work in teams, relate to people and manage conflict is a valuable asset in the workplace. This skill is important to get ahead -- and as you advance in your career, the aptitude to work with others becomes even more crucial. Personal accomplishments are important on your resume, but showing that you can work well with others is important too.

	It is imperative for college-bound students to function efficiently and appropriately in groups, collaborate on projects and accept constructive criticism when working with others. People who succeed only when working alone will struggle in college and beyond, as the majority of careers require collaboration.


	\subsection*{\it 2. Enthusiasm and Attitude}
	Give examples of how you improved employee morale in a past position, or how your positive attitude helped motivate your colleagues or those you managed. Earnest suggests: ``Some people are naturally bubbly and always upbeat. Others have a more tame and low-energy demeanor. Especially if you tend to be more low-key, smile when you shake the interviewer's hand and make an extra effort to add some intonation and expression to your responses.''

	Enthusiasm, Positive attitude, Accepting responsibility, Eagerness to learn new things, Open to new ideas

	
	\subsection*{\it 3. Verbal and Non-verbal Communication}
	Communication skills involve active listening, presentation as well as excellent writing capabilities. One highly sought-after communication skill is the ability to explain technical concepts to partners, customers and coworkers that aren't tech savvy.

	Students can demonstrate these skills through interaction with peers, communication with staff, participating in meetings, constructing e-mails, creating displays, writing letters, giving presentations, using appropriate body language, maintaining eye contact, actively listening, asking good questions, and speaking on the telephone.


	\subsection*{\it 4. Problem Solving and Critical Thinking}
	The ability to use creativity, reasoning, past experience, information, and available resources to assess issues and resolve issues is attractive because it saves everyone at the organization valuable time. Highlight this skill by listing an example of when your organization had a sticky situation and you effectively addressed it.

	Project management skills: Organization, planning and effectively implementing projects and tasks for yourself and others is a highly effective skill to have. In the past, this was a job in itself. Nowadays, many companies aren't hiring project managers because they expect all of their employees to possess certain characteristics of this skill.


	\subsection*{\it 5. Professionalism and Work Ethic}
	Employers are looking for employees that take initiative, are reliable and can do the job right the first time. Managers don't have the time or resources to babysit, so this is a skill that is expected from all employees. Don't make the hiring manager second-guess by sending a resume with typos, errors and over-exaggerated work experience.

	Employers are on the lookout for people who take pride in their work, and are confident enough to put their name to it. They also respect people who can hold their hands up when things go wrong, and don't pass the buck. Everyone makes mistakes -- it's how you react and learn from them that counts.

% 
% 	
% 
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 	
% 		\item Acting as a team player -- this means not only being cooperative, but also displaying strong leadership skills when necessary.
% 
% 		\item 5. Leadership: While it is important to be able to function in a group, it is also important to demonstrate leadership skills when necessary. Both in college and within the workforce, the ability to assume the lead when the situation calls for it is a necessity for anyone who hopes to draw upon their knowledge and ``hard'' skills in a position of influence.
% 
% 		Companies wish to hire leaders, not followers. The best way for students to develop this skill as they prepare for college is to search for leadership opportunities in high school. This could mean, among other things, acting as captain of​ an athletic team, becoming involved in student government or leading an extracurricular group. 
% 		
% 		\item Employers want employees who play well with others -- who can effectively work as part of a team. ``That means sometimes being a leader, sometimes being a good follower, monitoring the progress, meeting deadlines and working with others across the organization to achieve a common goal,'' says Lynne Sarikas, the MBA Career Center Director at Northeastern University.
% 
% 		\item A good team player has the team goals clear in their mind and works with others to achieve them. They are open and honest, and offer constructive suggestions and listen to others.
% 
% 		\item A report from The Economist Intelligence Unit found that 63 percent of executives believe today's workforce lacks collaboration and teamwork skills. How do you know if you personally lack such skills? Try asking yourself the following questions:
% 
% 		- Do you think your approach to things is always the best?
% 
% 		- Do you hate it when other people question your approach to things?
% 
% 		- Do you hate working on assignments that require you to rely on others in order to get work done?
% 
% 		\item No person is an island. You need to be comfortable working, collaborating and interacting with others. So pitch in when needed, respect others opinions, sit in on group meetings and provide solutions. 
% 
% 		\item Teamwork -- cooperative, gets along with others, agreeable, supportive, helpful, collaborative

% 
% 	It's more than just speaking the language. Communication skills involve active listening, presentation as well as excellent writing capabilities. One highly sought-after communication skill is the ability to explain technical concepts to partners, customers and coworkers that aren't tech savvy.

% 		\item It's more than just speaking the language. Communication skills involve active listening, presentation as well as excellent writing capabilities. One highly sought-after communication skill is the ability to explain technical concepts to partners, customers and coworkers that aren't tech savvy.
% 
% 		\item this is paramount to almost any job. Communication involves articulating oneself well, being a good listener and using appropriate body language.
% 		
% 		\item A common complaint among employers is that young people do not know how to effectively carry on a conversation and are unable to do things like ask questions, listen actively and maintain eye contact.
% 
% 		The current prevalence of electronic devices has connected young individuals to one another, but many argue it has also lessened their ability to communicate face-to-face or via telephone. These skills will again be important not only in college, where students must engage with professors to gain references and recommendations for future endeavors, but beyond as well.
% 
% 		An inability to employ these skills effectively translates poorly in college and job interviews, for instance. High school students can improve these traits by conversing with their teachers in one-to-one settings. This is also excellent training for speaking with college professors. Obtaining an internship in a professional setting is also a wonderful method to enhance communication and interpersonal skills.
% 
% 		\item This doesn't mean you have to be a brilliant orator or writer. It does mean you have to express yourself well, whether it's writing a coherent memo, persuading others with a presentation or just being able to calmly explain to a team member what you need.
% 
% 		\item This is perhaps the most common entry on person specifications for job vacancies, and for good reason. Skilled communicators get along well with colleagues, listen and understand instructions, and put their point across without being aggressive. They can change their style of communication to suit the task in hand -- this can be invaluable in many different situations, from handling conflict to trying to persuade a customer of the benefits of buying your product. If you've got good communication skills you should be able develop constructive working relationships with colleagues and be able to learn from constructive criticism.
% 
% 		\item Communication skills are one of the most important soft skills managers need to be effective. Managers must possess the ability to get their point across to employees, co-workers and customers. Effective communications ensures that everyone is on the same page and know what is expected of them.
% 
% 		\item The activities in this section will not only help participants practice and recognize how they provide information to others, but also help them consider how others may prefer to receive information. It is important to reinforce with participants that communication skills involve give and take -- and they can, indeed, be learned and strengthened over time.
% 		
% 		\item By ``communication,'' I mean more than just being able to exchange information with colleagues face-to-face, on the phone, and via emails and reports. Everyone can pretty much do that.
% 
% 		Rather, employers are looking for more advanced communication skills, particularly in the STEM fields. Businesses want employees who can communicate complex ideas clearly to the layman and the expert alike and through multiple mediums. Persuasion and negotiation skills are crucial in this respect. If you want to be a highly employable and progressive professional, you'll really need to master these advanced communication skills.
% 		
% 		\item Your interview is a great opportunity to demonstrate how well you communicate, so be sure you prepare and practice responses to showcase your best skills. Earnest says, ``Be concrete with these examples, and bring proof to the interview. Provide examples of materials you created or written campaigns you developed in past positions.''
% 		
% 		\item Articulate and skilled communicators are able to clearly express thoughts and ideas and understand the tasks at hand. Also, they get along with colleagues because they tend to be better listeners.
% 		
% 		\item Communication -- oral, speaking capability, written, presenting, listening.
